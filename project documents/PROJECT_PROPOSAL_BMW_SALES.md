# Project Title

## BMW Sales Insights (2010–2024) — Trend Analysis, Visualization & Reporting

---

## Problem Statement

**Issue:** Automotive stakeholders need clear, data-driven insight into historical BMW sales to inform inventory, marketing, and regional strategy decisions.

**Goal:** Identify historical trends and highlight performance by model and region to support actionable business decisions.

---

## Proposed Approach

- **Data sources:** Use the provided historical sales CSV (`BMW-sales-data-2010-2024.csv`).
- **Tools & methods:**
  - Clean and aggregate data with `pandas`.
  - Compute KPIs: year-on-year (YoY) growth, model and region share, seasonality metrics, and concentration measures.
  - Use time-series analysis to characterize.
- **Visualization & delivery:**
  - Produce clear static charts (PNG) for inclusion in reports or slides.
  - Build an interactive HTML dashboard (Plotly) so stakeholders can explore filters by year, model, and region.

---

## Expected Output

- **Deliverables:**
  - Executive summary of the analysis (.txt).
  - An interactive dashboard (single HTML file) that aggregates visualizations.
  - Static figures (PNG) suitable for presentation slides.
  - CSV exports containing cleaned data and computed metrics for reuse.
